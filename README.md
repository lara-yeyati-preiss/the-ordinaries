# The Ordinaries

**Live demo:** [https://lara-yeyati-preiss.github.io/the-ordinaries/](https://lara-yeyati-preiss.github.io/the-ordinaries/)

## Concept
This project approaches the American Revolutionary period (1765 – 1783) by shifting attention from monuments and heroes to the material traces of everyday life — from cooking pots and card games to stitched samplers and nursing bottles.

Objects are grouped in a **zoomable treemap by how they were used** — cooking, dressing up, performing music, decorating, and more.  

The treemap is paired with a **carousel** that spotlights selected artifacts, giving visitors an entry point to micro-stories that reveal the lived experiences behind the grand historical narrative.

## How it works
- **Treemap hierarchy:** first by **action family**, then by **object type**.  
- **Object panel:** lists the objects in each type with direct links to the Smithsonian catalog.  
  When available, images are fetched from the Smithsonian API and displayed next to each object name.  
- **Carousel:** showcases featured artifacts with images and captions.
